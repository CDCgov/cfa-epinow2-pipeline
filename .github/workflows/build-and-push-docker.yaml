# This GitHub Actions workflow builds a Docker image for the
# cfa-epinow2-pipeline-docker project. It consists of two jobs:
# build_image_dependencies and build_image.
#
# - The `build_image_dependencies` job carries out the first part of a
#   multi-stage build. It downloads and install all the dependencies
#   listed in the `DESCRIPTION` file. It uses the `Dockerfile-dependencies`
#   file to build the image.
#
#   The built image is then pushed to the corresponding registry.
#
#   The process is cached to avoid rebuilding the image if the dependencies
#   have not changed. This is by hashing the `DESCRIPTION` file and the
#   `Dockerfile-dependencies` file.
#
# - The build_image job builds the final image using the `Dockerfile` file.
#   It uses the image built in the previous job as a base image.
#
#   During the build process, the package is installed and built. Furthermore
#   the package is checked using `R CMD check` to ensure that it is working
#   correctly.
#
#   Once the image is built, it is pushed to the corresponding registry.
