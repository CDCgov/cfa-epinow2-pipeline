# CFA EpiNow2 Pipeline

## Overview

A lightweight wrapper around [{EpiNow2}](https://github.com/epiforecasts/EpiNow2) to add functionality for deployment in Azure Batch.
It holds some lightweight helper functions to interface with Azure services, convert input data to EpiNow2's expected input format, and save expected outputs. It also adds metadata and logging.

This package is meant to meet CFA's needs around model deployment in its computational environment.
The code is open source as part of CFA's goals around development, but it may not be possible to support extensions to additional environments.

## Structure

This repository holds an R package, `{CFAEpiNow2Pipeline}`.
The repository is structured as a standard R package.
All PRs pass R CMD check as part of the CI suite as a pre-condition for merge to main.

The package contains contains some adapters and wrappers to run `{EpiNow2}` at moderate computational scale, fitting hundreds or thousands of independent models in parallel with cloud resources.
The adapters read from datasets with standardized formats and produces outputs as flat files with standard names.

This package does _not_ manage pipeline deployment or kickoff, data extraction and transformation, or model output visualization.

## Components

1. **Config**: Model parameterization and input/output paths are specified by a config, with the path to this config passed at runtime.
    - The config is validated at runtime, but config generation is specified at pipeline runtime and not part of this package.
1. **Data**: Data load from the CFA data lake or from a local environment.
1. **Parameters**: Required parameters are read from the CFA data lake or from a local environment.
1. **Model run**: The R environment is managed such that the model runs from a fixed random seed, both for EpiNow2 initialization and Stan sampling.
1. **Outputs**: Model fits are saved as flat files with standardized formats and RDS objects.
1. **Logging**: Steps in the pipeline have comprehensive R-style logging, with the the [cli](https://github.com/r-lib/cli) package
1. **Metadata**: Model runs generate comprehensive metadata stored alongside outputs
