# CFA `{EpiNow2}` Pipeline

## Overview

A lightweight wrapper around [{EpiNow2}](https://github.com/epiforecasts/EpiNow2) to add functionality for deployment in Azure Batch.
It holds some helper functions to interface with Azure services, convert input data to EpiNow2's expected input format, and save expected outputs.
It also adds metadata and logging.

This package is meant to enhance the `{EpiNow2}` package to support deployment in CFA's computational environment.
The code is open source as part of CFA's goals around development, but it may not be possible to support extensions to additional environments.

## Structure

This repository holds an R package, `{CFAEpiNow2Pipeline}`.
The repository is structured as a standard R package.
All PRs pass R CMD check as part of the CI suite as a pre-condition for merge to main.
If interested in contributing see `CONTRIBUTING.md` and open an issue or a PR.

The package contains contains some adapters and wrappers to run to run many independent `{EpiNow2}` models in parallel with cloud resources.
The adapters read from datasets with standardized formats and produces outputs as flat files with standard names.
The wrapper functions enhance `{EpiNow2}` functionality to support cloud deployments, adding more logging and standardizing the R environment.

This package standardizes the interface to `{EpiNow2}` for purposes of deployment in a pipeline as part of a suite of models.
This package does _not_ manage pipeline deployment or kickoff, data extraction and transformation, or model output visualization.

## Components

This package implements functions for:

1. **Configuration**: Loads parameters such as prior distributions, generation intervals, and right-truncation from a config in a standard schema, with the path to this config passed at runtime.
    - The config is validated at runtime, but config generation is specified at pipeline runtime and not part of this package.
1. **Data load**: Loads data from the CFA data lake or from a local environment and translates it from CFA's schema to the expected `{EpiNow2}` format.
    - Paths are specified via the config
1. **Parameters**: Loads pre-specified and -validated generation interval, delay interval, and right-truncation distributions from from the CFA data lake or from a local environment and formats them for use in EpiNow2.
1. **Model run**: Manages R environment to run `{EpiNow2}` from a fixed random seed, both for `{EpiNow2}` initialization and Stan sampling.
1. **Outputs**: Provides functionality to process `{EpiNow2}` model fits to a standardised flat output format (as described in forthcoming link). Within the pipeline, model fits are saved both in their entirety as `.rds` files, as well as via this flat output format.
1. **Logging**: Steps in the pipeline have comprehensive R-style logging, with the the [cli](https://github.com/r-lib/cli) package
1. **Metadata**: Extract comprehensive metadata on the model run and store alongside outputs

## Configuration Specification
